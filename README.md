# Reactive-robotics
Repository for a challenge done for the course Introduction to Robotics at Radboud University. The reactive robot follows a line, crucially without having a map of the world (this is the essence of reactive robotics).

To run this yourself, download CoppeliaSim Edu, download the Python files and the .dll file and put them in the same folder. Then, load the map in CoppaliaSim Edu, start the simulation, and start the line follower Python script.
